The scenes in this folder were created by Erik Sintorn to test high-quality shadow rendering algorithms. You may find the 'villa' scene useful if you are working on
improving the quality of your shadow edges. The 'closedcitadel' scene is derived
from the 'EpicCitadel' scene, released by Epic Games as part of the UDK (Unreal
Development Kit, the free version of UE3), but contains only closed meshes.

If you use either of these scenes outside this class, you should credit Epic Games
and Erik Sintorn, and maybe email him as well. You can check out Erik's exciting
research on his website: http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~d00sint/

Note: The 'mycitadel.scene.original' file is the scene file used by Erik Sintorn's
code for his 2014 shadow-voxel-octree paper. It was originally named 'mycitadel.scene'
so the .original tag was added to differentiate the files. The additional material
parameters are probably not useful to you, but you can use this file if you decide
to download Erik's code (it has not been modified except for the name.)
